End to end data analysis project using Excel, SQL, and Power BI to uncover profitability drivers and business risks in the Global Superstore dataset.

---

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Global Superstore dataset to uncover key drivers of sales, profitability, and operational inefficiencies across regions, product categories, and customer segments.

The goal is not just to visualize performance, but to identify profit leakages, evaluate business risks, and recommend data-driven strategies that improve decision-making.

This is an end-to-end analytics project covering:
- Excel data preparation
- SQL data transformation (MySQL)
- Power BI dashboard development
- Executive-level insight generation

---

## Business Objective
Despite strong revenue performance, businesses often struggle with profitability due to:
- excessive discounting
- high product returns
- unprofitable product lines
- regional inefficiencies

This project answers the question:
##### Where is the company losing profit, and what actions will improve business performance?

- Joined Orders and Returns tables
- Aggregated total sales and profit
- Created grouped tables by:
  - region
  - category
  - segment
- Prepared analysis-ready dataset for Power BI

### Power BI
- Built KPI measures
- Designed executive dashboard

# Dashboard Overview
The dashboard was designed as an executive decision-support tool that answers critical business questions in under one minute.

Key components:
- KPI performance overview
- Sales & profit trends
- Regional performance
- Product profitability analysis
- Discount impact evaluation
- Return rate analysis
- Loss-making product identification

## Key Insights
### Overall Business Performance
- Total Sales: $12.64M
- Total Profit: $1.47M
- Profit Margin: 12%
- Total Orders: 25K

The business generates strong revenue but operates on moderate margins, indicating opportunities for profitability optimization.

### Regional Performance
- Central region recorded the highest profit: $311,403.88
- Canada region recorded the lowest profit: $17,817.39

This shows uneven market performance and the need for region-specific strategies.

### Profit Leakage Identified
- Tables sub-category recorded a loss of –$64,083.55

This product line is actively reducing company profitability and requires strategic review.

### Returns Impact
- Furniture category recorded the highest return rate: 5.92%

Returns increase operational costs and reduce margins.

### Sales vs Profit Relationship
Profit increases as sales increase, indicating revenue-driven profitability rather than efficiency-driven profitability.

The business relies more on volume than strategic product optimization.

---

## Business Problems Identified
The analysis revealed that profitability challenges are driven by:
- aggressive discounting
- high return rates
- loss-making product lines
- uneven regional performance

This is not a revenue issue.

It is a profit optimization problem.

## Strategic Recommendations
### Pricing Strategy Optimization
- Reduce blanket discounting
- Implement targeted promotional pricing
- Introduce profit-based pricing models

## Product Portfolio Restructuring
- Scale high-margin products
- Review or discontinue loss-making items
- Optimize category performance

## Return Reduction Program
- Improve quality control
- Refine product descriptions
- Enhance packaging and logistics

## Regional Strategy Optimization
- Increase investment in high-performing regions
- Redesign product and pricing strategies for underperforming regions

---

## Business Impact
If implemented, these recommendations can:
- increase profit margins
- reduce operational losses
- improve regional strategy
- optimize product investment decisions
- support executive decision-making
